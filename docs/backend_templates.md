### Root level
- package.json. A teleport template is a js package, this file describe the package.
- .teleport.json. The teleport configuration file.

### Into backend/servers
- .dockerignore
NB: the name of the folder should match the `serversByName` first key into the `.teleport.json`

### Into express-webrouter
#### app
In this folder you should put all files related to the app. In our example we have an `index.js` to describe the express app and some html templates.

Templates are always into the `templates` folder. You should at least have:
- `_index.html`
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head><% include _dev_bundle.html %></head>
  <body><% include _body.html %></body>
</html>
```

- `_index_prod.html`
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head><% include _prod_bundle.html %></head>
  <body><% include _body.html %></body>
</html>
```

- `_body.html`
```html
<div id="app_div"></div>
```
This is a placeholder for your frontend app. The `app_div` ID is very important as teleport will only match it.

- `_prod_bundle.html` and `_dev_bundle.html` can be empty. These are placeholders for js bundle generated by webpack frontend configuration, so they will be rewritten by a frontend template if you associated one with a backend template.

#### scripts
In this folder you should put all files related to deployment for the different platforms and scripts to start the application. There are 5 files per platform:  
- *build*: build the application.  
For Docker, build the image.
For Heroku, initialize the git repository and create a blank application.

- *push*: sush the application.  
For Docker, push the image into a registry and register the kubernetes configuration into a db.
For Heroku, push the code on the heroku remote repository.

- *run*: start the application.  
For Docker, launch the pod (container) regarding the kubernetes config.
For Heroku, start the application previously created.

- *deploy*: build + push + run.

- *start*: start the application locally.
