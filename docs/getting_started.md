# Getting started
## Installation
```
make install
```

## Setup backends
Teleport support for now 2 types of backend: Kubernetes and Heroku. We strongly recommend to start with Heroku in order to test the framework as Kubernetes needs a more complex infrastructure and specifics options to work.

### Heroku
To get started with heroku, just create an account (if not already done) on the platform: https://www.heroku.com/. Then install the command line tool https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli.  

Setup your credentials
```
heroku login
```

That's it! You are all set! :smiley:

### Kubernetes
TODO
[Additional setup](app_database.md) to the Kubernetes cluster.
